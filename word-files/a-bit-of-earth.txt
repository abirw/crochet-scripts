A bit of earth,
She wants a little bit of earth.
She'll plant some seeds.
The seeds will grow,
The flowers bloom,
But is their bounty
What she needs?
How can she chance
To love a little bit of earth?
Does she not know?
The earth is old,
And doesn't care if
One small girl wants things to grow.
She needs a friend.
She needs a father,
Brother, sister,
Mother's arms.
She needs to laugh.
She needs to dance,
And learn to work
Her girlish charm.
She needs a home,
The only thing she really needs
I cannot give.
Instead she asks
A bit of earth
To make it live!
She should have a pony,
Gallop 'cross the moor.
She should have a doll's house
With a hundred rooms per floor.
Why can't she ask for a treasure?
Something that money can buy,
That won't die!
When I'd give her the world,
She asks, instead
For some earth.
A bit of earth,
She wants a little bit of earth,
She'll plant some seeds.
The seeds will grow,
The flowers bloom,
Their beauty just the thing she needs.
She'll grow to love the tender roses,
Lilies fair, the iris tall.
And then in fall, her bit of earth
Will freeze and kill them all.
A bit of earth, a bit of earth,
A bit of earth, a bit of earth.
